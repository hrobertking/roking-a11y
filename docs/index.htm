      <h2>Roking-A11y Color Tuner</h2>
      <p>
        The <i>Color Tuner</i> is a design tool that allows you to see, and select, accessible foreground
        and background colors by calculating and displaying the contrast ratio for colors as well
        as modifying foreground and background colors to meet accessibilityguidelines for luminance
        contrast (WCAG 2.1, Guideline 1.4, Success Criterion 1.4.3 and Success Criterion 1.4.6).

      <h2>Roking-A11y APCA Evaluator</h2>
      <p>
        The <i>APCA Evaluator</i> is a design tool that will allow you to evaluate whether the font size
	is appropriate for the given lightness contrast between two colors. <strong>Please note that the Advanced
	Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) is an experimental approach, and should not be used to determine
        conformance to WCAG 2.x. Additionally, the code provided in the Evaluator may not conform to the most
	recent official version, resulting in different contrast values when compared to other versions of
	the algorithm.</strong>

      <h2>Roking-A11y Palette Tuner</h2>
      <p>
        Along with the Color Tuner, the Palette Tuner allows you to evaluate the contrast of an entire
        palette at one time.

      <h2>Roking-A11y Readability Tool</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          The <i>Readability Tool</i> calculates the <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i>, or LIX, and <i>Ordvariationsindex</i>,
          or OVIX, for content. The <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i> was developed by Carl-Hugo Björnsson in the late 1960s,
          nearly a decade prior to the readability tests primarily used in the US that were developed by
          <span aria-label="doctors">Drs.</span> Flesch and Kincaid. Unlike the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests,
          i.e., the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> and the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>, the <i>LIX</i> is not
          tied to a single language by using a syllable count to determine word complexity - the <i>LIX</i> uses
          word <em>length</em> to determine word complexity. The <i>Ordvariationsindex</i> measures the number of
          <em>unique</em> words in a passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason this is important can be demonstrated by examining two short sentences - one in English
          and the other in Spanish - "drink this medicine" and "tomar este medicina" and passing them through
          the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> test and the <i>LIX</i> to see if the readability scores are significantly
          different or close.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both phrases, "drink this medicine" and "tomar este medicina", are three words in one sentence and,
          using the <i>LIX</i> measure, each contains one <em>complex</em> word. Where they differ significantly,
          however, is in the syllable count - the English phrase contains five syllables and the Spanish phrase
          contains eight. When we compute the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> for these phrases, we get a score of
          <strong><em>62.9</em></strong> for the English phrase and a score of <span aria-label="negative">-</span>21.8
          for the Spanish phrase. Their <i>LIX</i> scores, however, are both 36.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The higher the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score, and the lower a <i>LIX</i> score, the easier text is to
          read. A <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score that falls between 60 and 70, as the score for the English phrase
          does, <em>should</em> correspond to a eigth or ninth grade reading level. A <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score
          that falls between 0 and 30, which is still <em>much</em> higher than the score for the Spanish phrase,
          <em>should</em> correspond to a college graduate reading level and is considered very difficult to read. A
          <i>LIX</i> score of 50 for US English, on the other hand, <em>should</em> correspond to a first or second
          grade reading level.
        </p>

        <h3>Reliability of the Läsbarhetsindex and Ordvariationsindex</h3>
        <p>
          There are several methods by which the readability of a text can be assessed. <em>Most</em> assessment
          methods require data beyond the text itself - either the number of syllables a word contains or the
          part of speech a word is, or even its place in a dependency tree. The amount of data necessary for these
          assessments can be significant and does not lend itself to a quick estimation of the readability of 
          a text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the various assessment methods, the <em>most reliable</em> analysis, aside from a human assessment,
          is an assessment based on ratios between parts of speech, such as nouns, pronouns, adverbs, and verbs, 
          which matches human assessments 96 to 97 percent of the time. A dependency distance assessment 
          <a href="#liu-2008">(Liu, 2008)</a> is the next best analysis with approximately 89 percent accuracy.
          Unfortunately, both - a parts-of-speech analysis and a dependency distance analysis - require a dictionary
          and/or dependency map for each language or text analyzed, and the analysis takes more than the few seconds 
          the simpler, shallow feature assessments, Läsbarhetsindex and Ordvariationsindex, which achieved 
          approximately 85 and 86 percent accuracy, respectively.

      <h3>Caveats</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>There are US jurisdictions in which a maximum <em>reading grade level</em> is established for
            content.</strong> The <i>LIX</i> <em>cannot</em> be used in those situations, you
            <strong><em>must</em></strong> use the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>. There have not been an
            adequate number of samples used to determine if there is a relationship between the <i>LIX</i> and
            reading grade level, so if reading grade level is important in your consideration, it is recommended
            that you use the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i> and note that its results apply <em>only</em> to
            English text.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Some samples are too short to accurately measure. For this reason, the Roking-A11y Readability Tool
            will only score samples containing more than five words.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Simple <em>readability</em> tests such as the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>, <i>LIX</i>, or
            <i>OVIX</i>, provide a <em>quick</em> analysis; however, a quick analysis, by its nature, lacks
            depth. A readability analysis should always be considered alongside the text and the context in
            which the text is presented, and with the understanding that not all readers are alike. For
            example, a document containing highly-specialized language or jargon may not be comprehensible
            even though its score indicates otherwise.
          </p>
