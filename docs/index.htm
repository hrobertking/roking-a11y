				<h2>ROKING-A11Y APCA Evaluator</h2>
				<p>
					The <i>Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm</i> (APCA) was developed to take into consideration how
					colors are <em>perceived</em>. This approach avoids what has become known as "the orange button problem".
					To demonstrate the orange button problem, consider the two following buttons. The button labeled
					<b>LCR 6.44:1</b> has a higher <i>Luminance Contrast Ratio</i> than the button labeled
					<b>LCR 3.26:1</b>. In fact, the lower contrast of white on orange would not pass the WCAG 2.x
					test for contrast for text, even though it typically appears to be <em>more</em> readable than the higher
					contrast black on orange.

					<span style="display: block;">
						<button style="background-color: #e86826; color: #fff; padding: .25em;">LCR 3.26:1</button>
						<button style="background-color: #e86826; color: #000; padding: .25em;">LCR 6.44:1</button>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					As a factor in the legibility of text is the font size and weight in relation to the contrast,
					the <i>APCA Evaluator</i> compares font size and weight to the required contrast level. The APCA
					Evaluator is, therefore, a design tool that will allow you to evaluate whether the font size
					is appropriate for the given lightness contrast between two colors.

					<strong>
						Please note that the Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) is an experimental approach,
						and should not be used to determine conformance to WCAG 2.x. Additionally, the code provided in the
						Evaluator may not conform to the most recent official version, resulting in different contrast values
						when compared to other versions of the algorithm.

				<h2>ROKING-A11Y Color Tuner</h2>
				<p>
					The <i>Color Tuner</i> is a design tool that allows you to see, and select, accessible foreground
					and background colors by calculating and displaying the contrast ratio for colors as well
					as modifying foreground and background colors to meet accessibilityguidelines for luminance
					contrast (WCAG 2.1, Guideline 1.4, Success Criterion 1.4.3 and Success Criterion 1.4.6).

				<h2>ROKING-A11Y Readability Tool</h2>
 			<p>
				There are several methods by which the readability of a text can be assessed. In the US, the <em>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</em> is the most common readability score; however, some will use the <em>Flesch Reading Ease</em> to evaluate English language resources.</p>

<p>
 <em>Most</em> assessment
					methods require data beyond the text itself - either the number of syllables a word contains or the
					part of speech a word is, or even its place in a dependency tree. Of the various assessment methods, the <em>most reliable</em> analysis, aside from a human assessment,
					is an assessment based on ratios between parts of speech, such as nouns, pronouns, adverbs, and verbs,
					which matches human assessments 96 to 97 percent of the time. A dependency distance assessment
					<a href="#liu-2008">(Liu, 2008)</a> is the next best analysis with approximately 89 percent accuracy.


				Unfortunately, both - a parts-of-speech analysis and a dependency distance analysis - require a dictionary
					and/or dependency map for each language or text analyzed, and the analysis takes more than the few seconds
					the simpler, shallow feature assessments.

The result of this need for extra data is that the methods do not lend themselves to a quick estimation of the readability of
					a text, and are difficult, or impossible, to automate. Further, and perhaps more significantly, these analysis methods are each tied to a single language. 
				</p>
<p>From an accessibility evaluation perspective, a method that is accurate, fast, not language dependent, and capable of being automated, is a better option. 
</p>

			<h3>Reliability of the Läsbarhetsindex and Ordvariationsindex</h3>
	
				<p>Two shallow feature assessments, the <em>Läsbarhetsindex</em>, or LIX, and the <em>Ordvariationsindex</em>, or OVIX, have shown approximately the same level of accuracy compared to human assessment as a dependency distance analysis, at 85 and 86 percent accuracy, respectively.</p>
			
<p>Neither the <i>Läsbarhetsindex</i>, developed by Carl-Hugo Björnsson in the late 1960s,
					nearly a decade prior to the readability tests that were developed by
					<span aria-label="doctors">Drs.</span> Flesch and Kincaid,
					i.e., the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> and the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>, nor the <em>Ordvariationsindex</em>, is
					tied to a single language by using a syllable count to determine word complexity - the <i>LIX</i> uses
					word <em>length</em> to determine word complexity, and the <i>Ordvariationsindex</i> measures the number of
					<em>unique</em> words in a passage.
				</p>

				<p>
					The reason this is important can be demonstrated by examining two short sentences - one in English
					and the other in Spanish - "drink this medicine" and "tomar este medicina" and passing them through
					the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> test and the <i>LIX</i> to see if the readability scores are significantly
					different or close.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both phrases, "drink this medicine" and "tomar este medicina", are three words in one sentence and,
					using the <i>LIX</i> measure, each contains one <em>complex</em> word. Where they differ significantly,
					however, is in the syllable count - the English phrase contains five syllables and the Spanish phrase
					contains eight. When we compute the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> for these phrases, we get a score of
					<strong><em>62.9</em></strong> for the English phrase and a score of <span aria-label="negative">-</span>21.8
					for the Spanish phrase. Their <i>LIX</i> scores, however, are both 36.3.
				</p>
				<p>
					The higher the <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score, and the lower a <i>LIX</i> score, the easier text is to
					read. A <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score that falls between 60 and 70, as the score for the English phrase
					does, <em>should</em> correspond to a eigth or ninth grade reading level. A <i>Flesch Reading Ease</i> score
					that falls between 0 and 30, which is still <em>much</em> higher than the score for the Spanish phrase,
					<em>should</em> correspond to a college graduate reading level and is considered very difficult to read. A
					<i>LIX</i> score of 50 for US English, on the other hand, <em>should</em> correspond to a first or second
					grade reading level.
				</p>		
	
<p>Both LIX scores are well within the correct range, and use a method to calculate readability that is accurate, fast, language-independent, and is capable of being automated. For these reasons, the ROKING-A11Y Readability Tool uses LIX.</p>

				<h3>Caveats</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<strong>There are US jurisdictions in which a maximum <em>reading grade level</em> is established for
						content.</strong> The <i>LIX</i> <em>cannot</em> be used in those situations, you
						<strong><em>must</em></strong> use the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>. There have not been an
						 adequate number of samples used to determine if there is a relationship between the <i>LIX</i> and
						reading grade level, so if reading grade level is important in your consideration, it is recommended
						that you use the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i> and note that its results apply <em>only</em> to
						English text.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Some samples are too short to accurately measure. For this reason, the ROKING-A11Y Readability Tool
						will only score samples containing more than five words.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Simple <em>readability</em> tests such as the <i>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level</i>, <i>LIX</i>, or
						<i>OVIX</i>, provide a <em>quick</em> analysis; however, a quick analysis, by its nature, lacks
						depth. A readability analysis should always be considered alongside the text and the context in
						which the text is presented, and with the understanding that not all readers are alike. For
						example, a document containing highly-specialized language or jargon may not be comprehensible
						even though its score indicates otherwise.
